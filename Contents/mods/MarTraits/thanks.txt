this mod was inspired by two other mods I personally used in my playthroughs of Zomboid.

- "More Traits" https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1299328280&searchtext=more+traits
This mod's open source on github helped me immensly in making my own project, and as a coder does, parts of this code are probably ripped straight out of there when in a state of distraught
A couple Traits of my favorite traits as well made their way from their mod into this one.
I redid some of the code for these, gave them new icons, and changed a couple of their names to better suit the style of this mod.
Full Thank you's to everyone who worked on that mod otherwise this one would not have been possible or even thought of.

- "Simple Overhaul: Traits and Occupations" https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2840805724&searchtext=simple+overhaul
A couple occupation ideas, and a single trait has been inspired from this mod.
They are closed permissions sadly, but all of my code and artwork is entirely original, and almost all traits/occupations inspired work different functionally.

It was partly the lack of compatability between these two mods, but mainly my wish to make my own that pushed me to create this.
