description=[b][u]Many of this mod's traits were directly inspired by the "More Traits" mod.[/u][/b]
description=While this mode uses original code and art, and many of the traits work different functionally. I expressively asked for permission from the More Traits creator (HypnoToadTrance) to quell my own worries of even stealing "ideas" and to keep many of the names and similar icons to honor the original.
description=This mod actually originally started as just my attempt at remaking some of the icons in that mod, but spiraled way out of control into it's own separate entire thing. so thanks More Traits!

description=[b][u]And admittedly some parts "Inspired" by SOTO: Simple Overhaul Traits and Occupations.[/u][/b]
description=So credit is due to the second mod this is built off of and to I believe the sole creator of that mod "Hea"
description=I didn't have permission then but I believe I do now.
